Notes

1. ER Diagram doesn't contain an implemented change in the conceptional framework of the database. Specifically, when the table diagram was being
created, the cardinality of the relationship between students-courses changed from 1-n to 1_or_n-n.

2. When running the sql query files, execute them in ascending order starting from 1 e.g 1, 2a, 2b, 3
   This will make sure the database will be correctly created with its tables before any queries run.

3. After the database is created properly, you can try out the console app in the visual studio solution folder.
